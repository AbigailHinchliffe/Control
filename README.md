# How to Play:
# Aim: Wipe out your opponent
# The Game rotates in three phases: Fortify, Attack & Defend

# **Fortify Phase & Rules**
# ---------------------
# In this phase, you get allocated a certain number of troops dependant on how many continents you have conquered, and you get to place them onto any territories that you happen to own. You also get given a new card at random which you can collect, in order to spend on more troops later on in the game. 
# You have access to the arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen to adjust how many troops you wish to place on your highlighted territory, but once you have placed down your troops, you cannot adjust this until the defend phase. *There is no time limit to this phase*
# Once you have made your selections and the troop count has hit 0, you automatically go into your attack phase. *This is timed*
# **Only** during the fortify phase, can you trade in cards, otherwise you keep your existing cards and will only be able to use them again for the next fortify phase.

# **Attack Phase & Rules**
# ---------------------
# In this phase, you have a timer, in which you can End pre-emptively if you wish to end your turn, otherwise, you can attack any neighbouring enemy territories
